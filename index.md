```

### What to expect?
 
How it Works

1. Register for the event via [WhatsApp](https://wa.me/27677024410?text=Hi!%20I'm%20interested%20in%20attending%20the%20meet'n%20match.) or 'sign up' on the Facebook page [@islamicmatchmakingcapetown](https://www.facebook.com/islamicmatchmakingcapetown). To ensure equal numbers of men and women, DO pre-register!
2. On the day, you show up at the event dress neatly in smart casual clothing, get your name tag and match sheet.
3. Feeling nervous?! Not to worry, we got you covered! There will be an option to take a little “starter kit” that will help kick start your conversation.
4. The event will begin with a short ice breaker to help break the tension before the actual "meets" begin.
5. You will then get to meet with 6 to 10 (or more) other singles in less than 2 hours (via a series of 5-minute "one-on-one meets").
6. We will facilitate it so that you are guaranteed to meet many of the singles present at the event in a safe and fun way.
7. On your match sheet, you decide who you’d like to know better and they would do the same.
8. At the end of the event, you hand in your match sheet with the selections into the prescribed boxes that will be on-site at the event.
9. Islamic Match-making will then email each guest a list of participants who would like to hear from them again! Odds are you’ll have one or more matches.
10. After that, it’s up to you!
